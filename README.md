# ghostapi-cli
Like wp-cli, but for Ghost's v2 content and admin APIs

***NOTE: this only provides a command-line interface to the Ghost APIs, it does not provide any blog management capabilities. See [Ghost-CLI](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-CLI) for the management CLI tool. To avoid naming conflicts, this is named ghostapi-cli rather than ghost-cli***
